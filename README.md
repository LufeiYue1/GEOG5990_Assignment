Background


The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) provides data on how deprived different parts of the UK are. While the specific methods used to measure deprivation vary slightly between different countries, they all consider factors like income, employment, education, health, crime, housing access, and the quality of the environment. This project aims to discuss the relationship between IMD and education in London.
